# Agent Instructions

This repository uses a TODO-driven workflow.

1. Read `TODO.txt` in the repository root.
2. Select an unchecked item to work on.
3. Implement the chosen TODO item.
4. When finished, mark the item as completed in `TODO.txt` by replacing `[ ]` with `[x]`.
5. Commit your changes with a descriptive message.

Repeat for future tasks.

If your change adds or modifies functionality, update `DOC.md` to keep the usage instructions current.
