# TODO List for Java Thread Dump Analyzer

## Project Setup
- [x] Initialize Java project structure with modules for parser, analysis, CLI, and web UI.
- [x] Configure build to produce a standalone JAR with minimal dependencies.

## Data Model
- [x] Implement core data model classes: `ThreadDump`, `ThreadInfo`, `StackFrame`, `LockInfo`.

## Parsing Layer
- [x] Implement `HotSpotParser` for standard HotSpot thread dumps.
- [x] Implement `HsErrParser` for `hs_err_pid.log` crash files.
- [x] Implement `OpenJ9Parser` for IBM/OpenJ9 `javacore` dumps.
- [x] Implement parser factory/format detector to choose parser based on file content.
- [x] Implement `JsonThreadDumpParser` for JSON-based dumps.

## Analysis Engine
 - [x] Compute thread state statistics per dump.
 - [x] Detect deadlocks and report involved threads and locks.
- [ ] Identify lock contention hotspots (many threads waiting on the same lock).
- [ ] Aggregate stack trace hotspots (common methods/frames).
- [ ] Group identical stack traces and similar thread names.
- [ ] Support multi-dump comparison and timeline of thread states.
- [x] Create `AnalysisSession` model to manage multiple `ThreadDump` objects.
- [ ] Provide advisory engine with heuristic checks for common thread anti-patterns.
- [ ] Flag potential high CPU threads appearing RUNNABLE across dumps.
- [ ] Integrate optional CPU usage data (e.g., from `top -H`) to correlate CPU percentage with thread IDs.
- [ ] Categorize threads into JVM internal vs application threads for filtering and grouping.
- [ ] Release old `ThreadDump` objects from memory after analysis to conserve RAM when many dumps are loaded.

## Reporting & Export
- [ ] Generate HTML report with charts and tables.
- [ ] Export analysis results to PDF.
- [ ] Provide option to limit stack trace depth in PDF export.
- [ ] Export analysis results to CSV.
- [ ] Export standalone HTML report that bundles assets.

## CLI Interface
- [x] Implement command line interface using a parsing library (e.g., Picocli).
- [ ] Support options for output format and selecting analysis features.
- [ ] Add CLI option `--show-deadlocks-only` to display only detected deadlocks.

## Web Interface
 - [ ] Launch embedded Jetty server with upload form for thread dump files.
 - [ ] Support uploading multiple thread dump files at once in the web UI.
- [ ] Display results dashboard with charts, thread tables, and analysis highlights.
- [ ] Integrate Chart.js for rendering charts in the web UI.
- [ ] Use Datatables or similar for searchable/sortable thread tables.
- [ ] Provide comparison view for multiple dumps.
- [ ] Include context-sensitive help/tooltips in UI.
- [ ] Provide glossary page with definitions for thread states and daemon threads.
- [ ] Provide REST API endpoints for SPA/JSON consumers.
- [ ] Implement pagination or virtualization for large thread tables.
- [ ] Allow pasting raw thread dump text in addition to file uploads.
- [ ] Add interactive stack trace viewer with highlighting of blocking lines.
- [ ] Parse uploaded files asynchronously to keep the UI responsive.

## Visualization
- [ ] Provide flame graph visualization for stack trace hotspots.
- [ ] Add timeline chart showing thread state counts across multiple dumps.

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for parsers and analysis engine.
- [ ] Integration tests for CLI and web workflows.
- [ ] Unit tests for REST API and Json parser.
- [ ] Provide sample thread dumps for test fixtures.

## Documentation
- [x] Expand README with usage instructions for both CLI and web interfaces.
